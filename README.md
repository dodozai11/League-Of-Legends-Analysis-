The League of Legends Regional Performance Analysis is a case study conducted at UCSD, with the goal of exploring performance vs region
on the international stage in 2025.

# Introduction
League of Legends is a popular multiplayer game developed by Riot Games released in late 2009. In this study we will be utilizing a dataset from Oracle's Elixer,
that records data from professional matches through 2025.

In the realm of League of Legends esports, the rivalry between Eastern regions and Western regions has long captivated fans and analysts alike. This regional divide extends beyond
geography, rather it represents fundamentally different approaches to strategy, aggression, and resource management. However, in recent years the gap has increased and it seems now 
that Westtern teams are no where near capable of achieving results the way Eastern teams have. In fact, a Western team has not won Worlds since Fnatic in season 1, and that is only 
because there were no Korean or Chinese regions yet, which are the powerhouses of today. Eastern teams are often characterized by their aggressive early 
game play and decisive teamfighting, while Western teams are sometimes perceived as more methodical. Understanding these regional differences is crucial for coaches developing
international strategies, analysts predicting tournament outcomes, and fans appreciating the nuances of competitive play.

Do Eastern and Western regions demonstrate significantly different gold efficiency and early-game performance in professional League of Legends matches? Specifically, we want to 
investigate how teams from different regions convert economic advantages (gold leads) into combat success (kills and objectives), and whether early-game statistics at the 15-minute 
mark differ systematically between East and West. Using data analysis techniques, we will examine regional patterns in gold differences, objective control, and game outcomes.
Furthermore, we will develop a predictive model to forecast match winners based on 15-minute game states, while ensuring this model treats both regions fairly.
